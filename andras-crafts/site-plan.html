        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This is the plan for a website for a small business I plan on starting at somepoint in the future. I like to
            knit and crochet and often make my own patterns, so this business would be selling completed items and patterns
            to anyone looking for a handmade gift or a new patterns to follow.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience of this website is anyone with a creative mind looking for new patterns, or anyone who likes the
            idea of handmade toys as gifts but doesn't have the creative talent to make their own.</p>

        <p>
            Welcome to Andra's Crafts! Here you will find just about any trinket you can think of, 
            and patterns to make your own.
            <br>
            A little about me:<br>
            I love to make everything from toys to food. I've loved to crochet and knit 
            since I was little, and have recently started making my own patterns.
        </p>
        <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <h3>Gallery</h3>
        <p>
             - Image gallery of everything available<br>
             - Will eventually have clickable links to product pages<br>
             - Will either have the patterns below the toys, 
            or might make patterns their own subpage once I have enough to need that<br>
            
        </p>
